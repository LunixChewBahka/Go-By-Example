The Stack

- Represents the "state" of execution
- Composed of stack frames
- Each frame holds a function call and lcoal variables
- Last in First Out

What's wrong with it?
** One stack = one execution state
** Stacks usually have a pre-defined capacity
** need to duplicate the entire model for concurrency (bad for concurrency)
---- if you call too many functions and go deep you are going to have a stackoverflow

	a, b := 1, 2
	// this is only for demonstration purposes
	result := level1(a, b)

// 2nd frame on the stack
func level1(c, d int) int {
	// add another argument to satisfy level2
	e := 3
	return level2(c, d, e)

// last frame that was added on the stack
